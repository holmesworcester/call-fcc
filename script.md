Thanks for participating. In a moment, we'll connect you to a random employee at
the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau. Tell them that Commissioner Tom
Wheeler is corrupt and needs to resign. If enough people do this, their phones
will be ringing off the hook all the time, and our voices will be impossible to
ignore.

To begin, press star now. If you'd like us to also call you back at the same
time tomorrow, press 9.

Ok thanks. Have fun, and remember to be polite.
