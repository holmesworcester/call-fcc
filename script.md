Call the FCC Script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Jeff Lyon from CallTheFCC.com. In a moment, we'll connect you to a
random employee at the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau. Tell them that
Commissioner Tom Wheeler is corrupt and needs to resign. 

If you'd like, we can also call you back every day around this time so you can
keep calling the FCC and reminding them to do the right thing by firing Tom
Wheeler. Being a daily caller is completely optional and you can stop at any
time. With enough callers, the FCC's phones will be ringing off the hook all the
time, and our voices will be impossible to ignore.

To make a single call to the FCC right now, press star. To also
schedule a daily call starting tomorrow, press one.

--- if user presses 1

* Thanks! We'll call you back around this same time tomorrow. You can stop
  receiving these calls at any time by following the in-call menu or emailing
  support@callthefcc.com

Alright! We're connecting you to the FCC now.
